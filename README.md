# AdSkipper for YouTube

Python program to constantly scrape chrome for the skip advert button while a YouTube video is playing. Clicking on it when it appears.

## Description

As someone who likes YouTube's algorithm for music suggestion I'm willing to put up with an advert every now and then. But as someone who also gets 50 minute long adverts I find it inconvenient to have to stop what I'm doing to skip the advert after the designated 5 seconds.

## Usage

Run this command from your terminal:
```bash
python3 yt.py <link to video>
```

The terminal will remain open and Chrome will launch in a "testing mode".

Example:
```bash
python3 yt.py https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
```
